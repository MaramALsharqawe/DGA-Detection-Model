# DGA-Detection-Model
DGA detection is the process of identifying domain names generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), used by malware for communication with command and control servers. Machine learning models are used to analyze network traffic and domain name patterns. 

## Introduction 
<h3>The project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) from a dataset of 20,200 domain entries. The model uses advanced machine learning techniques and feature engineering to enhance detection and mitigation of DGAs, thereby strengthening network security against evolving cyber threats.</h3>
## Project: DGA Detection Objectives

1. Data Set
2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
3. Choose the Machine Learning Model
4. Train the Model
5 .Validation with Unseen Data Set
6. Save the Model in a Pickle File

### besed on the result the random forest is the best model for DGA detection with an acuracy of 0.95
